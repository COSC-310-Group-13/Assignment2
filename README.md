# Assignment2 - An Interactive Conversational Agent

This Project was developed by Sebi Unipan, Chinmay Gopal, Iwan Levin, Amritpal Aujla and Ali Ibrahim.


#Description

This Project aims to impersonate a psycariatrist in the form of an online chat-bot. More specifically, this online chat-bot needs to be able to offer real world advice and be able to hold a conversation with a real person. Our Chat-bot specializes in helping Univesity students with mental health issues such as depression, loneliness and stress.

Our Team truly believes that anyonymous online conversation with an inteliigetn chat-bot can aleviate mental stresses without the added expenses a real psycariatrist would require. 

This converstational bot was developed entirely in Python using the Natural Language Processing library, Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK).
