# Assignment 2 - An Interactive Conversational Agent

This Project was developed by Sebi Unipan, Chinmay Gopal, Iwan Levin, Amritpal Aujla and Ali Ibrahim.


## Description

This Project aims to impersonate a psychiatrist in the form of an online chat-bot. More specifically, this online chat-bot needs to be able to offer real world advice and be able to hold a conversation with a real person. Our Chat-bot specializes in helping Univesity students with mental health issues such as depression, loneliness and stress.

Our Team truly believes that anonymous online conversation with an intelligent chat-bot can aleviate mental stresses without the added expenses a real psychiatrist would require. 

This converstational bot was developed entirely in Python using the Natural Language Processing library, Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK).

## Installation

To be able to run the chat bot, you need the nltk and sklearn packages.
Open up command prompt and type the following:
`pip install nltk`
`pip install -U scikit-learn`
The chat bot also auto installs these packages if you do not have them already installed.
Afterwards, you may run the Main.py file and the bot should work accordingly.
